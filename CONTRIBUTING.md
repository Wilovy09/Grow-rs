## Code Standards

- Follow Rust best practices using rustfmt and clippy.
- Write tests for any new changes in tests/.
- Keep your code modular and easy to read.

## Commit Standards

We use the Conventional Commits standard. Here are the most common types:

- `feat`: For new features.
- `fix`: For bug fixes.
- `docs`: For documentation changes.
- `style`: For code formatting changes (without affecting logic).
- `refactor`: For code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `test`: For adding or correcting tests.
- `chore`: For updates to tools or auxiliary tasks.

**Example commit:**

```bash
git commity -m "feat: added support for multiple users"
```

## Pull Request Review

- Contributions will be reviewed by a team member.
- If needed, youâ€™ll be asked to make adjustments before the PR is approved.
- Use descriptive labels and reference related issues (e.g., Fixes #123).
